# advent-of-code-24
My solutions to the Advent of Code 2024 coding challenges written in Go (unless I change my mind on a few days). This is an excuse to learn Go and play around with the syntax, so don't judge anything you see here too harshly...

Not going for the most efficient code you've ever seen, but the goal is to avoid any brute-force solutions. Some days have strange solutions (mostly regex) as I was working those problems without access to a file-reading system like the other problems have. 

I was keeping track with each day pretty well until life got in the way, but they're too fun to leave undone -- so here we are!
